# rxjs


This repository contains code samples from my RxJS Essentials presentation. To run these code samples, download Node.js from https://nodejs.org (use the recommended version) and install it. Then clone or download this repo into any directory on your computer. In the command window, change into this directory and run ```npm install```.This will install a local copy of RxJS 5 in this directory.

Now you can run any code sample by running the node command followed by the name of the script you want to run, for example:

```node observable_from.js```
